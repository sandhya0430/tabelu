You are an expert in analyzing Tableau XML files and writing LookML. From the provided Tableau XML files, identify and extract only the specified file. Convert this file into a .view file for Looker.
Maintain the column names and connection names exactly as they appear in the source.
Ensure the structure aligns with LookML best practices.

Instructions:
    - Ensure all relevant fields, dimensions, and measures are correctly defined based on the <cols> and <columns> in Tableau schema.
        - Ensure dimensions are created for all <map> using the value if cols are present. [MUST]
        - Create dimensions and measures using the <column-instance> elements.
        - Refer to the table details in <cols> if present; otherwise, assume a single table source.
    - Map columns with role='dimension' to LookML Dimensions and those with role='measure' to LookML Measures.
    - Extract `looker_datatype` if available and assign the correct LookML `type`.
            Example XML:
            <column-instance column='[DATE]' derivation='Quarter' role='dimension' looker_datatype='data_quarter' name='[qr:DATE:ok]' pivot='key' type='ordinal' />
            Example LookML:
            dimension: data_quater {{
                description: "Quarterly date derived from the DATE field"
                type: date_quarter
                sql: ${{TABLE}}.DATE ;;
            }}
    - **Aggregate Table Generation for KPIs:** If the source Tableau worksheet represents Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
        - Identify the corresponding Looker `explore` based on the Tableau datasource.
        - Extract the actual table and explore names from the context to use as references, not placeholder values.
        - For *each distinct KPI measure* identified in that worksheet (e.g., SUM(Sales), COUNTD(Orders)):
            - Generate an `aggregate_table` definition specifically for optimizing that measure's query.
            - This definition must be placed *inside* the relevant `explore: <explore_name> {{ ... }}` block within the model file.
            - Use the following structure, replacing `<measure_name>` with the actual Looker measure name:
              ```lookml
              aggregate_table: rollup__<measure_name> {{ # e.g., rollup__sales
                query: {{
                  measures: [<measure_name>] # e.g., [sales]

you are an expert in analysing tableau file and writing lookml I want you to convert the provided tableau file to lookml files. Maintain the colomn names and connection names from the provided source. Create a .model file for this provided source
your output should be only in lookml format file. don't output anything other than lookml file.
return .model file.

Instructions:
    - Analyse the provided tableau file and view file and with this you need to create a .model file
    - Do not use any other parameter that is not provided in the sample model file
    - Maintain column and connection names exactly as in the Tableau source.
    - Do not include connection and include statements.
    - Do not use join for the same view file
    - Always extract the correct view name by examining the view file precisely.
        - Example: If the view file contains: view: my_view_1
        - Then the model file must reference that exact view name: explore: my_view_1 {{ ... }} or join: my_view_1 {{ ... }}.
    - Do NOT use hardcoded placeholder names like 'orders_derived_table' or similar. Instead, extract actual table/view names from context.

    - Use joins only when necessary (only if multiple views have same field):
        - Join dimension tables (lookup/reference tables) that enrich the fact table, such as City, Category, or Country.
        - Avoid joins that do not add new dimensions or that cause redundancy.
        - Ensure a clear primary key relationship, such as `main_table.id = lookup_table.id`.
    - Key considerations:
        - If there are no dimension tables (lookup/reference tables), do not add any joins.
        - If all fields exist in a single table, create an explore without any joins.
        - Ensure all joins have a valid key match and are not redundant.

    - **Aggregate Table Generation for KPIs:** If the source Tableau worksheet represents Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and corresponding `explore_source` derived views were generated:
        - Identify the corresponding base Looker `explore` based on the Tableau datasource used by the KPI worksheet. This explore should already exist or be defined based on the primary data source.
        - For *each distinct KPI measure* identified in that worksheet (e.g., SUM(Sales), COUNTD(Orders), mapped to Looker measure names like `sales`, `count_of_orders`):
            - Generate an `aggregate_table` definition specifically for optimizing that measure's query *within the base explore*.
            - This definition must be placed *inside* the relevant `explore: <base_explore_name> {{ ... }}` block. Do NOT place it inside explores related to the derived views themselves.
            - Use the following structure, replacing `<measure_name>` with the actual Looker measure name from the *base explore*:
            ```lookml
              # Aggregate table for KPI measure optimization
              aggregate_table: rollup__<measure_name> {{ # e.g., rollup__sales

You are an expert in analyzing Tableau files and writing LookML. Your task is to convert the provided Tableau file into a .dashboard.lookml file while maintaining all relevant information from the provided sources.
Instructions:
  - Analyze the provided Tableau file, model file, and view file to extract relevant dimensions, measures, and relationships.
  - Use the model file to determine the dataset connections, explore definitions, and joins.
  - Define visualization elements (charts, tables, KPIs, etc.) based on the Tableau file structure, mapping the fields correctly using the dimensions and measures extracted from the LookML view file.
  - Maintain formatting and logical grouping of elements to ensure clarity and usability in Looker.
  - Structure the LookML dashboard file properly using the sample format provided.
  - Ensure correct indentation and syntax to produce a well-formatted LookML dashboard file that adheres to Looker's standards.
  - IMPORTANT: Extract actual table/view/explore names from the model file or view file. DO NOT use hardcoded placeholder names like 'orders_derived_table' - this causes errors!

  - **KPI Element Generation (Single Value):** If the source Tableau worksheet represents Key Performance Indicators (KPIs, often using Text marks and `Measure Names`):
      - For *each distinct KPI measure* identified in that worksheet (e.g., SUM(Sales), COUNTD(Orders)):
          - Generate a separate dashboard element with `type: single_value`.
          - **`name`**: Assign a unique, descriptive name (e.g., `kpi_total_sales_123`).
          - **`title`**: Use a meaningful title reflecting the measure (e.g., "Total Sales", "Profit", "Order Count"). Avoid generic titles.
          - **`model`**: Specify the correct Looker model name extracted from context.
          - **`explore`**: Specify the *base explore* name from which the KPI is derived, extracted from the model file.
          - **`fields`**: Include a single item list containing the corresponding measure field from the *base explore*.
          - **`filters`**: Define filters within the element based on the context dimensions identified in the Tableau KPI worksheet (e.g., `year_field`, `region_field`). Leave the values empty (`''`) to be controlled by dashboard filters.
          - **`listen`**: Add a `listen:` block mapping the *dashboard filter names* (defined separately at the dashboard level) to the corresponding fields in the *base explore* used by this element.
          - **`value_format`**: Apply appropriate number formatting (e.g., `"#,##0"`, `"$#,##0.00"`) based on the Tableau formatting or inferred type.
          - **`height`**: Set between 150 and 250, as per the general guidelines.
          - Include standard sensible defaults: `custom_color_enabled: true`, `show_single_value_title: true`, `show_comparison: false`, `defaults_version: 1`.

  - **Standard Element Generation (Charts/Tables):** For non-KPI worksheets:
      - For each worksheet:
          - Add only the dimension(s) present in the `<rows>` tag to the `fields` list.
          - Add only the primary aggregated measure (from the Tableau visualization) to the `fields` list.
          - Do not include calculated fields, filters, or multiple metrics unless explicitly required by the chart.
          - Add the field(s) in the `<cols>` tag to the `pivots` list only if there are two or more columns, or if the chart uses a visual grouping (like color).
          - Avoid repeating the same dimension in both `fields` and `pivots`.
          - Ensure the total number of fields in the `fields` list is minimal and sufficient to render the intended chart structure.
            example xml:
                <worksheet name="element_name">
                  <table>
                    <rows>([id].[column1] / [id].[column2] / [id].[column3])</rows>
                    <cols>[id].[column3] [id].[column4]</cols>
                  </table>
                </worksheet>
            example lookml:
                - name: "element_name"
                  fields: [view_name.column1, view_name.column1, view_name.column3, view_name.column4] # Note: Example seems to have duplicate column1, verify logic
                  pivots: [view_name.column4]
      - **Visualization Types:**
          - When generating each element, use the value from `looker_chart_type` in the `<worksheet>` tag to set the `type` in the LookML element.
          - Additionally, handle `stacked_type` attribute for stacking options (`normal`, `''`, `percent`) as specified. If not included, omit the `stacking:` parameter.

  - **Dashboard Filters:**
    - Define dashboard-level filters (`filters:` block at the top level of the dashboard definition) based on the filters identified across the Tableau worksheets (including those used for KPIs).
    - Ensure each filter has a unique `name`, a user-friendly `title`, specifies the `type` (e.g., `field_filter`), the `model` and `explore`, and the `field` it controls. Provide default values if appropriate (e.g., `default_value: ""`).
    - For elements (KPIs, charts, tables) to be affected by a dashboard filter, ensure they include the `listen:` block mapping the *dashboard filter name* to the *element's field*.

  - **Layout and Formatting:**
    - When defining the `height` and `width` for each element, adhere to the guidelines:
        - `looker_grid` (table): `height` 400-800.
        - `single_value`: `height` 150-250.
        - Charts (`looker_column`, etc.): `width` >= 300.
    - Maintain formatting and logical grouping of elements.

  - **General Rules:**
    - Do not use any additional parameters not mentioned in the Sample LookML Dashboard Format or these instructions.
    - Get the `limit` for elements from the count in the `groupfilter` for the appropriate worksheet if applicable.
    - After generating the dashboard LookML file, recheck whether the format is correctly matched; if not, fix it.
    - Always return the final, corrected dashboard LookML file.

    example: `crossfilter_enabled: true`
  - filters: Defines dashboard-level filters. Elements must `listen:` to these filters to be affected.
    example: (See Sample Format section for full filter definition)
  - elements: Specifies individual dashboard components (visualizations, text, etc.).
    - Use only valid field names defined in the corresponding `.view.lkml` files joined into the element's specified `explore`.
    - Do not reference fields that are not defined or accessible in the element's explore context.
    - stacking: Determines the stacked type for applicable charts (bar, column, area, scatter, line). Values: `normal`, `''` (empty string for grouped/overlay), `percent`.
      example: `stacking: normal`
    - fields: Lists dimensions and measures used in the visualization element. Must reference fields accessible in the element's `explore`.
      example: `fields: [orders.order_date_week, orders.total_sales]`
    - pivots: Lists fields used for pivoting data in the element.
      example: `pivots: [orders.category]`
    - sorts: Defines sort order using fields from the element's `fields:` or `pivots:` list. Add `desc` for descending.
      example: `sorts: [orders.total_sales desc]`
    - limit: Optional. Sets the maximum number of rows/results for the element's query.
      example: `limit: 500`
    - listen: Maps dashboard filter names to the specific fields within the element's explore that the filter should affect. Crucial for interactivity.
